# PayloadCMS Revalidate Example Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). And  then PayloadCMS was added to the project/

The project is supposed to demonstrate the minimal required code to get a change in the CMS to trigger and update of an associated page in the front end of the application.
